This is a django project, The main aim is to sell coffee in stock. Every data is collected and saved in mySQL.

The project aims at distribution of quality coffee for users by selecting their favourite brand from the app. This requires consent from the producers. It willtherefore prompt the companies to come up with quality coffee.

The languages used are:
1. HTML & CSS for basic layout.
2. JavaScript for functionality.
3. Django framework 
4. MYSQL for database management.

In future we want to host, all coffeee producers and compete from a similar starting point.
